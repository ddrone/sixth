# So I guess the question is how the definitions should work
# Do I allow the define to define arbitrary constants, or only functions?
# Maybe it makes sense to limit it to funtions at the moment. In which case,
# I might actually prefer special syntax for the function definitions,
# compared to anonymous blocks. Or maybe it does not actually matter that
# much, it's not like the types of brackets have only one kind of usage in
# other programming languages.
